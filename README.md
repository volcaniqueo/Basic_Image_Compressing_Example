# Basic_Image_Compressing_Example
This was my project for the course CMPE 362 (Introduction to Signal Processing for Computer Engineers) at Bogazici University. This project uses DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) and DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) for two different image compressing examples.

## Details
This project uses DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) and DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) for two different image compressing examples and provides comparison between these methods.

## To Run the Code
The code can be easily run with MATLAB application. Make sure you have the example images and the code in the same directory.
